# Basic_FoodDeliveryApp

During my bachelor's at SJB Institute of Technology, Bangalore, I worked on a basic food ordering system as a project to explore full-stack development concepts Angular and Java Spring Boot. This project was a hands-on experience in building user authentication, database management, and real-time updates.

💡 Project Highlights:
✅ User Features:

A Login & Registration system for customers and merchants.
A Welcome Page displaying user details with an option to place orders.
A Menu Page showing available food items, dynamically updating inventory.
Cart & Payment Integration, where purchased items update both the menu and database in real time.

✅ Merchant Features:

Merchants can log in, view their details, and modify the menu.
When a merchant adds stock, a POST request updates the database instantly without requiring a page refresh.
This project helped me understand backend operations, database transactions, and user experience design—laying the foundation for my journey into full-stack development. 🚀
